# Flat Heroes tribute - web remake

Started this in ~2022 as a personal tribute to a fun game I love and played a lot with my kid.
These are the first 10ish levels.

## Why?

I'm a gamer and love building games too. Game design is a lot of fun. Wanted to reverse engineer this game to understand
its design better.
Techwise, exploring particles.

## Features

- minimal 3D scene with keyboard controls
- no mobile support

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. `pnpm install`

## Project Status

WIP and on hold. Haven't touched in a while, fell into other rabbit holes...
No commits/git history: was never pushed to github and sort of done in one go.
